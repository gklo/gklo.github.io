###Opinion on licenses - Apple’s license and GPL

Mac OSX 10.9 license:  <a href="http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX109.pdf">http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX109.pdf</a>  
GPL:  <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0</a>

<ul>
<li>Proprietary licenses are incredibly long to cover every single detail of their product for protecting both their company and customers. There is even a different agreement especially for each product or each release of the product. On the other side, open licenses are usually one page long and generally apply to all software</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GPL is the only license that prevents companies from using source code for commercial purpose, otherwise all relevant proprietary software source code has to be released</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proprietary software usually collects data from user by default, that may confuse the users who don’t read the long license and are not willing to share their data with the company.</li>
</ul>
