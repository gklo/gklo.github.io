As a rookie of node.js programming, I encountered lots of problems at the beginning.  The first thing confusing me is the callback structure of node.js programming.  While most of my previous experiences are on procedural programming, learning asynchronous program is a new challenge to me.  For instance, node.js program doesn't run from top to bottom.  Instead, it involves lots of asynchronous functions to avoid disk I/O or network I/O slowing down the main process.  Therefore, even though there are code files in the project for references, it still takes me some time to recognize the place where I should put my custom code in.  Another issue I encountered is came from the build/test tool - grunt.  Honestly, I had no idea about grunt.  It seems to be a build tool like ant and gradle, but the thing is I am failed to find the way to run debugger when testing.  I end up spending a lot of time on testing.  There are also some minor issues about javascript.  Unlike c++ or java, dynamic data types in javascript cost me a bit of time to figure out variable types.  Overall, after the release 0.1, I can feel that I learned a lot about node.js and open-source cultures.  Thanks to the help from my professor Dave and my friends who attended the class.
