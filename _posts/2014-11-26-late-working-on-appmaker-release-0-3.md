For Release 0.3, in order to have different experience, I chose a bigger project to work on - Appmaker.

##Pull request

<https://github.com/mozilla-appmaker/appmaker/pull/2370>  
<https://github.com/mozilla-appmaker/appmaker/pull/2371>

##Previous pull request for 0.2 (since I forgot put the link into 0.2 blog post)

<https://github.com/mozillafordevelopment/webmaker-app/pull/386>  

<br/>The first problem I encounter is an error about "loginHost for webmaker-auth":

```bash
Warning: PUBLISH_HOST is unset. See README.md for more info.
Warning: ASSET_HOST is unset. See README.md for more info.

/home/rickdom/seneca/osd600/appmaker/node_modules/webmaker-auth/index.js:14
 throw new Error('(webmaker-auth): secretKey was not passed into webmaker-a
 ^
Error: (webmaker-auth): secretKey was not passed into webmaker-auth
 at new module.exports (/home/rickdom/seneca/osd600/appmaker/node_modules/webmaker-auth/index.js:14:11)

```

However, this took me a whole week to figure out how to fix the problem... End up the reason I got this because I forgot to do one step:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

Really, it is too important to follow every single step in README.md, especially for big project.  

<br/>In this release. I also found a really easier way to search for elements on the page.Â  When I want to get the code that handles the close button on tab, I can simply search for the title/alt, "Delete this card", to get the file that contains the code.
